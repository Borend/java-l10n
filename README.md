# Java Localization demo

Double click `run.bat` to build and run the demo.

Code is located in [app > src > main](app/src/main).

If something's broken or you get errors about files in use, open the `scripts` folder, double click `win-clean.bat` (Windows) or `mac-linux-clean.sh` (Mac/Linux), then try again.
